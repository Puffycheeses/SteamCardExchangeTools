# Steam Card Exchange Tools
Adds a more advanced search and highlighting, Its not the best code but It does improve the time it takes to find cards

[Click to install](https://github.com/Puffycheeses/SteeamCardExchangeTools/raw/master/Steam%20Card%20Exchange%20tools.user.js) - (Requires Tampermonkey )

# What does it do
This script adds small box in the top left of the bots inventory on the site and allows you to highlight content by value and ammount.

Green = Matches price, Matches card amount and there is no markup on the cards.  
Orange = Matches price, Matches card amount and there is a markup on the cards.  
Pink = Matches card amount.

# How to use efficently 
This script makes searching the bots inventory easier and more efficent. I am assuming you know how to earn credits on the bot    
1. Make sure the script is installed
2. Go to [The bots inventory](http://www.steamcardexchange.net/index.php?inventory)
3. Change "Show 10 entries" to "Show 500 entries" (Do not do "all")
4. Set the card value to what you want
5. Set the card set to what you want
6. Select the offer found (Make sure you have the right amount of credits)
7. Right click on send offer and click open in new tab (Repeat for each card)
8. Send offer (Repeat for each card)
10. Wait for the cards to come through!

I recomend setting value to 6 and set to 5 so it only costs 30 credits to get a full set.
